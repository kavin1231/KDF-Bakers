                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2015, The Sweet Spot started from a small home kitchen with a big dream: to create the most delightful and visually stunning cakes that bring joy to every occasion. Our founder, Jane Doe, a passionate baker since childhood, poured her heart and soul into perfecting her recipes and cake decorating techniques.</p>
                <p>What began as a hobby, baking for friends and family, quickly blossomed into a beloved local business known for its commitment to quality, creativity, and personalized service. We believe that every cake has a story to tell, and we're honored to be a part of our customers' most cherished moments, from birthdays and weddings to anniversaries and simple "just because" celebrations.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to combine the finest, freshest ingredients with artistic flair to craft cakes that are not only beautiful but also incredibly delicious. We are dedicated to making your sweet dreams come true, one cake at a time.</p>
